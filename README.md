# Milestone Project One - St Johns Gaa Club
###   Code Institute - Full Stack Development Course - User Centric Frontend - Conor Greene 

This is a project completed by Conor Greene as part of my participation in the Full Stack Development course with Code Institute.

I will be illustrating my knowledge gathered from partaking in the first three modules of this course. The languages I will be focusing on are HTML and CSS. 

I will be building a website for my local GAA club. The club is called St John’s GAA. The goal of this website is to offer informative content about St. John’s GAA club.

## UX

**Strategy**

The main goal of this website for current club members and potential club members is to:

- Provide information about the GAA club.
- Show the location of the GAA club.
- Offer an opportunity to contact a member of the GAA club.


The goal of the website for the club committee is to:

- Offer an online medium to inform the public about the GAA club.
- Increase the number of people joining the GAA club within the community.
- Creating an online platform that acts as a point of contact for the GAA club.

**Scope**

The scope is to try to attract new members to the St John’s GAA club but also update current members of the GAA club. Subsequently, the 4 keys pieces of information that I would like to communicate are as follows;

- News about St Johns GAA Club
- Information about St Johns GAA Club
- An opportunity to contact a club representative
- Learn about the location of St Johns GAA Club

**User Stories**

1. As a potential user (and returning user), I want to check for news about St John’s GAA Club.
2. As a potential member, I want to check the location of St John’s GAA Club as I have never been there before and want to know where it is located.
3. As a potential member, I want to learn about the club and it’s history before deciding to join.
4. As a potential member and returning member I want to see if St John’s GAA Club has social media presence so I can see what other people on Facebook are saying about them.
5. As a potential member or returning member I want to be able to visit St John’s Gaa Club on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop. I expect it to work on mobile.
6. As a potential customer I want to see images of members of St John’s GAA Club.
7. As a potential customer I want to be able to contact St John’s GAA Club if the website does not answer all my questions. I want to see a contact form so I can submit information.
8. As the club chairman, I want to have a good online presence that entices users to join our GAA club. 

**Skeleton/Wireframes**

I used Figma to draft my wireframes. Figma is a platform I have experience using so I opted to use it over Balsamiq. I expect the wireframing process will aid me throughout the execution stage.

**Surface**

I took inspiration from the St Johns GAA Club colors when planning the colour scheme. The primary color being a sky blue and the secondary color being navy. These colours are familiar with club members that will be visiting the page and blue also creates a sense of trust among users. 

I used fontpair.co as inspiration when defining typography. Final research was complete on Google Fonts and I decided to combine the Roboto and Domine font families. The sans-serif font of Roboto was used in the body and the serif font of Domine was used within the heading structure. 

When designing the website I utilised a mobile first approach.

## Features

Noted below are the features that were implemented within this project. Also included is a note on features that could be implemented in future iterations.

**Navbar**

The Navbar was built with a mobile first approach. It includes:
- The logo in the top left includes a path to link back to the home page.
- On the right side the main components of the webpage are linked. These include a link to the homepage, a link to the about us section and a link to the contact form.

**Contact Us Form**
- A contact us form was created so users could acquire more information if their questions were not already answered. 
- There are 3 input elements; the user's name, email and a message. The only required element is the email address and user’s name. This will be adequate information for the club chairman to reach out to an interested user.

**Footer**
- The footer allows the user to access more external information via social media. Each platform is linked and will open in a new tab.

**Future Iterations**
- A map would be added to pinpoint the exact location of the GAA club. Currently only the area is mentioned.
- I would link the GAA clubs instagram via a carousel feature that would display up to date imagery of the club
- I would include a blog section where the chairman could upload news snippets about the GAA club.

## Technology

**HTML**
- For building the structure and basis of the webpage.

**CSS**
- Used to style the webpage.

**Google Fonts**
- Used to upload custom fonts to my webpage.

**Font Awesome**
- Used to add custom icons to my webpage.

**Github**
- Used to store documentation, code using a version controlled approach.

**Gitpod**
- Used as a cloud based IDE. 

**Git**
- Used to utilise version control throughout my project.

## Testing
- HTML: I used W3C Mark-up Validation to check the visibility of errors within my HTML codebase. A fatal error was spotted with the <body> tag and subsequently fixed.
- CSS: W3C CSS Validation was used to check errors within my CSS codebase. No errors were spotted. 
- A tool that I found in the code institute slack group called Responsinator was used to test the responsiveness of my website across different devices. An error was address with my Navbar whereby the contact us link floated to the left. I re-adjusted the order and added a display attribute to the CSS to correct this change.
- I used Chrome Devtools throughout my project for testing of responsiveness for mobile. 

**User Story Testing**
1. As a potential user (and returning user), I want to check for news about St John’s GAA Club.
- *At the bottom of each page social media links have been included to find out more information about St Johns GAA Club. In hindsight this could be made more clear and in future iterations I would add a dedicated news section.*

2. As a potential member, I want to check the location of St John’s GAA Club as I have never been there before and want to know where it is located.
- *The GAA clubs address is mentioned in the about us section. In future iterations I would include a map so users could automatically find directions via a platform like Google Maps.*

3. As a potential member, I want to learn about the club and it’s history before deciding to join.
- *The club’s history is mentioned in the about us section.*

4. As a potential member and returning member I want to see if St John’s GAA Club has social media presence so I can see what other people on Facebook are saying about them.
- *Links to the club’s social media presence can be found in the footer.*

5. As a potential member or returning member I want to be able to visit St John’s Gaa Club on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop. I expect it to work on mobile.
- *The website is developed with a mobile approach in mind.*

6. As a potential customer I want to see images of members of St John’s GAA Club.
- *Members of the GAA club are included. In future iterations I would include a carousel linked to the GAA club’s Instagram page.*

7. As a potential customer I want to be able to contact St John’s GAA Club if the website does not answer all my questions. I want to see a contact form so I can submit information.
- *A contact form has been included on the webpage.*


8. As the club chairman, I want to have a good online presence that entices users to join our GAA club. 
- *Information about the GAA club has been communicated alongside the principles that the GAA club adheres too.* 

## Deployment

This webpage was developed using Gitpod as an IDE, committed to GIT and pushed to Github. The project was then deployed on Github pages using the following steps. 
Log into GitHub.

1. Selected repository from GitHub dashboard.
2. Select ‘Settings’ at the top of the chosen repository.
3. Scroll down to GitHub Pages section.
4. Under ‘Source’ click the drop-down menu and select ‘Master Branch’.
5. Once selected, the page auto refreshed, and the website was deployed.
6. JimLynx tutorial entitled workflow with Git, Gipod and Github was a useful resource throughout this process.
