# Milestone Project One - St Johns Gaa Club
###   Code Institute - Full Stack Development Course - User Centric Frontend - Conor Greene 

This is a project completed by Conor Greene as part of my participation in the Full Stack Development course with Code Institute.

I will be illustrating my knowledge gathered from partaking in the first three modules of this course. The languages I will be focusing on are HTML and CSS. 

I will be building a website for my local GAA club. The club is called St John’s GAA. The goal of this website is to offer informative content about St. John’s GAA club.

## UX

**Strategy**

The main goal of this website for current club members and potential club members is to:

- Provide information about the GAA club.
- Show the location of the GAA club.
- Offer an opportunity to contact a member of the GAA club.


The goal of the website for the club committee is to:

- Offer an online medium to inform the public about the GAA club.
- Increase the number of people joining the GAA club within the community.
- Creating an online platform that acts as a point of contact for the GAA club.

**Scope**

The scope is to try to attract new members to the St John’s GAA club but also update current members of the GAA club. Subsequently, the 4 keys pieces of information that I would like to communicate are as follows;

- News about St Johns GAA Club
- Information about St Johns GAA Club
- An opportunity to contact a club representative
- Learn about the location of St Johns GAA Club

**User Stories**

1. As a potential user (and returning user), I want to check for news about St John’s GAA Club.
2. As a potential member, I want to check the location of St John’s GAA Club as I have never been there before and want to know where it is located.
3. As a potential member, I want to learn about the club and it’s history before deciding to join.
4. As a potential member and returning member I want to see if St John’s GAA Club has social media presence so I can see what other people on Facebook are saying about them.
5. As a potential member or returning member I want to be able to visit St John’s Gaa Club on my mobile device as I do not own a laptop or desktop. I expect it to work on mobile.
6. As a potential customer I want to see images of members of St John’s GAA Club.
7. As a potential customer I want to be able to contact St John’s GAA Club if the website does not answer all my questions. I want to see a contact form so I can submit information.
8. As the club chairman, I want to have a good online presence that entices users to join our GAA club. 

**Skeleton/Wireframes**

I used Figma to draft my wireframes. Figma is a platform I have experience using so I opted to use it over Balsamiq. I expect the wireframing process will aid me throughout the execution stage.

**Surface**

I took inspiration from the St Johns GAA Club colors when planning the colour scheme. The primary color being a sky blue and the secondary color being navy. These colours are familiar with club members that will be visiting the page and blue also creates a sense of trust among users. 

I used fontpair.co as inspiration when defining typography. Final research was complete on Google Fonts and I decided to combine the Roboto and Domine font families. The sans-serif font of Roboto was used in the body and the serif font of Domine was used within the heading structure. 

When designing the website I utilised a mobile first approach.
